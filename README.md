## ðŸ‘‹ Welcome
Thanks for stopping by. This project is moving the tko.org website under version control to allow more collaborators to work on the site platform. This is separate from the content of the site which is managed primarily by TKO staff. If you are interested in contributing see the Get Involved section below.

## Requirements
* PHP
* Composer
* Docker (and docker-compose)

## Usage
1. Fork the repo.
2. Run `docker build -t wordpress-with-composer .` from the projects root.
3. Run `docker compose up -d` from the projects root.
4. Open web browser to `localhost:8000`
5. Run `docker compose down` to shut down the site.

### Adding plugins
1. Use `composer search` to find the correct package
